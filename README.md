# turbokit

Python library for designing and simulating turbomachinery.

Currently supports using OpenFOAM to define free-vortex flows.  Would eventually
like to expand this 

## Examples

## Dependencies
- Python (3, developed against 3.3)
- PyFoam
- OpenFOAM (developed against 2.3.1)
- Scipy/numpy
- Matplotlib (only for plotting functions)

### Recommended
- Paraview (visualization of OpenFOAM data)
- Meshlab (great for viewing STL files)
